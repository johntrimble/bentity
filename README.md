# Bentity
Bentity is a simple OSX Python script for escaping text with the appropriate
HTML entities. I wrote it late one night 4 years ago for my coworker Ben, and
then basically forgot about its existence until about a month ago when Ben 
asked if I could fix a bug he found in the script. Apparently this script is 
still widely used by the front-end developers at 
[meltmedia](http://www.meltmedia.com), who have been passing it around via
email attachments and iChat messages. To bring some sanity to the distribution
mechanism, I decided to throw it up here on GitHub.

This application has about the worst UX imaginable, and I'm certain there are 
many characters that it does not properly escape. That being said, if you're
copying content from something like a Word document to dump into some HTML, 
this tool can save you a lot of time.
